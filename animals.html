        <p> We never really had a proper house type cat, all we had was a few outdoor and wild type cats. I would always beg my parents for just one house cat as it would be nice to have something to take care of, and becuase i can relate to a cat! Well getting Lola was probably one of the best accidents that could happen, My older siser had asked one of her friends to bring down a kitten from mitchelstown when she was coming to visit the next week. My mother didnt like this at all, My sister was told to tell the friend not to bother. My sister managed to <em>"Forget"    </em>so after being in work all day I got a call to say that there was a cat at home and not to tell my parents yet. In the end, I managed to gain a cat and my parents got a free pass on my birthday present.

        <h2> Luna</h2>
        <div class="my_animals">

         <p>Luna is a bunny I got after moving out on my own. I found her at Maxi Zoo in Waterford, where she had been for quite some time without anyone adopting her. She was already an adult, around 9 to 10 months old, and when the store worker told me no one had taken her, I couldnâ€™t help but feel bad so I decided to bring her home.

            Luna has a quirky personality and often behaves more like a puppy than a rabbit. One of her funniest habits is running in excited circles around me whenever I bring her food bowl, Just waiting for me to pour out her food.
