        <h2>About Me </h2>
        <p>My name is Pierce Moran, I am 22 years old and I'm currently studying Creative Computing at SETU Waterford.
        </p>
        <p>I attended secondary school at Dungarvan College before enrolling in a Level 7 Social Care course at SETU. However, due to family issues during that year, I had to take a break from my studies. During my time away, I realized I wanted to pursue a different path. After completing my first year in college, I applied to switch to my current course, Applications and Multimedia Development.

            <br> I also live by a quote from <a class="web_links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt"> Eleanor Roosevelt: </a> </p>
        <blockquote>"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams"</blockquote>
